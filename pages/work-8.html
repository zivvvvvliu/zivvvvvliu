            <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
            <p>In this paper, we introduce GazeLabel: a data labeling system with public displays (at bus stops, metro
              stations, shopping malls, etc.) using eye-tracking technology. With built-in cameras, the proposed system
              captures pedestrians’ gaze points on the screen, from which we can extract information and get a
              substantial amount of free labeled data. Based on this idea, we implemented a prototype eye-tracking
              data-labeling system for binary image classifications. A pilot study demonstrated the potential and
              practicability in a data labeling process using GazeLabel.

            <p>As the state of the art, Deep Learning is widely used in fields such as computer vision, voice
              recognition, and natural language processing. The learning process is driven by data, which needs to be
              labeled. therefore, data-labeling is a crucial step in deep learning projects. Currently, the most common
              approach to such task is “crowdsourcing", such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk [1]. Yet, despite its speed and
              flexibility, crowdsourcing requires trivially detailed design, demands large amount of financial and human
              resources, and become difficult to manage due to variance in labelers’ abilities.
              The prevalence of public displays such as advertising screen panels, allows all sorts of information to be
              disseminated in the form of images and videos. Recent years, some research work has shown that gaze eye
              tracking could help us analyze the passers-by attention to enable users to interact with public displays.
              Such as EyeScout [4], GazeHorizon [5], AggreGaze [6]. In addition, eye-tracking technology has advanced
              rapidly. Especially deep learning method applied [3]. A single camera can achieve user’s eye tracking
              without calibration. Furthermore, an AI company Megvii (face++) has opened gaze estimation API [2] free
              for developers. We attempt to equip public displays with eye-tracking technology to solve the issues in
              crowdsourcing of data labeling.
              To reduce complexity and cost in crowdsourcing management, we propose to use public displays (at bus
              stops, metro stations, shopping malls, hospitals, etc.) as new data-labeling platforms, drawing support
              from pedestrians to voluntarily help us label data. We could setup a camera on the panel to capture the
              audience’s gaze points and apply a tailor-made user-interaction design to the screen, allowing the
              passing-by audience to help us label data almost unconsciously.
              The realization process of such eye-tracking data-labeling system is as follows. First, with the built-in
              camera of the screen panel, the system monitors and collects the audience’s gaze points with eye-tracking
              technology. The system then identifies an area on the screen that received greater attention (measured by
              gaze frequency and fixation duration on the area). The label decision represented by such area will be
              marked as “selected”. The decision from this panel could then be sent to the system’s backend server,
              which collects the decision votes from all panels and labels the data with the decision that received the
              most votes. Such approach captures user-inputs passively and single-directionally, so the traditional
              user-interaction based on mouse and keyboard cannot apply, where the next piece of data appears
              immediately upon completion of the previous. In the proposed system, only one data-piece is displayed over
              a specified amount of time, and all passerby would be attempting this same labeling task. The display
              duration of every data-piece is determined by frequency of passerby. The duration decreases as frequency
              of labeling attempts by passerby increases, and vice versa.
              Most urban cities have large numbers of advertising screen panels, indicating the system’s potential to
              label large amounts of data very quickly. Take Beijing as an example: there are at least millions of
              advertising screen panels in the city (Beijing has over 300 metro stations, over 700 hospitals, more than
              200 large shopping malls, and tens of thousands of bus stops). Suppose an image labeling task requires 20
              minutes to complete on the proposed system and assuming that it could work up to 18 hours per day, tens of
              millions of data-pieces could be process and labeled every single day. The scale of efficiency from this
              system could be very considerable and has the ability to provide a substantial amount of labeled data.
